#The S3-Robot Governance Framework algorithm enables distributed, consent-based decision-making among autonomous robots. It classifies action drivers into three types—safety-critical, operational, and optimization—each requiring a corresponding consent level: automatic, active, or full. The process begins with proposing an action and determining the necessary consent level based on the urgency and impact scope of the action. For full consent, the algorithm involves presenting the proposal, confirming understanding among affected robots, gathering reactions, resolving any objections, and finalizing consent. Throughout, the framework maintains transparency by logging all decisions and supports scalable multi-robot coordination via dynamic role selection and established consent patterns.
